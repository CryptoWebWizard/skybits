           <h1>Privacy Policy</h1> 


<p>A Subscriber that is a business, organization or an individual that is using the Services for commercial purposes (entities referred to as Business Subscribers in our Terms of Service) may control certain or all aspects of its Business Subscriber User's Accounts. In order to make this Privacy Statement more readable, we refer to a Business Subscriber as an "Employer" with the understanding that the defined term may not be technically accurate in all cases.</p>

<p>Privacy on www.SkyBitsinfotech.com and other sites we operate (each, a "Site") is of great importance to us. Because we
gather important information from our Users of the Sites and related services provided by SkyBits Infotech Private Limited
(the "Services"), we have established this Privacy Statement as a means to communicate our information collection, use and
dissemination practices. In order to access and use the Sites and/or Services, you must agree to our Terms of Service.
Capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Statement will have the meaning ascribed to them in the Terms of Service.</p>

<h2>SCOPE OF THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT</h2>
<p>This Privacy Statement describes SkyBits Infotech Private Limited's use of Personal Information and Anonymous Information that we collect from your use of, or access to, the Sites and Services, whether you are an individual or a company, as well as information we may use to update the information you provide us through other means. "Personal Information" means contact information (i.e., your name, address, email address, and/or telephone number) and any other non-public information that is used or intended to be used to personally identify an individual. "Anonymous Information" means information that is not used or intended to be used to personally identify an individual.</p>

<h2>INFORMATION COLLECTED</h2>
                 <h4>Personal Information</h4>
                 <p> In general, the Personal Information we gather enables us to provide the Sites and Services to you. We collect Personal Information that you submit to us voluntarily. When you register with us and create an Account, we may ask you to provide certain Personal Information, such as your name, email address and phone number. We may request additional optional information to support your access to the Sites or Services. When you communicate with us by sending us an email, we may collect and store any information that is contained in your communications with us. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but this may limit the features of the Sites or Services you are able to use. Please note that if you are a Business Subscriber User, we may receive Personal Information about you from your Employer (such as your name and email address). We also collect certain Personal Information from Subscribers in order to process subscriptions, including credit card numbers and associated billing information, to charge and collect the subscription fees. We refer to this information as "Billing information". If you are a Subscriber that has purchased the Services through one of our resellers, we may receive from them Personal Information they have collected.</p>

<h2> Google Apps Data</h2>
<p>The contents of Google Apps Data can include both Personal Information and Anonymous Information such as email addresses, home addresses, telephone numbers and other content communicated over email or inside contact fields, but we treat Google Apps Data differently regardless of its contents</p>
<p>We will access and use your Google Apps Data only when you (or, if you are a Business Subscriber User, your Employer, to the extent permitted by such Employer's policies) grants us explicit permission to do so for troubleshooting purposes. We will not otherwise view, access or use the contents of your Google Apps Data without your written consent, but may view the related file system information (e.g., folder names, file extensions and sizes but not your file contents) to provide technical support. Google also has its own privacy policy, terms &amp; conditions, and you have to compulsory follow it, so please refer once on google.com website.</p>
<h2>Anonymous Information</h2>
<p>As you use the Sites or Services, certain Anonymous Information may be passively collected and stored on our or our service providers' server logs, such as your Internet protocol address, domain names, browser type, and access times.

We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your browser until you delete them) to improve your experience on the Sites (e.g., by keeping you logged in). Persistent Cookies can be removed by following your Internet browser help file directions. If you choose to disable Cookies, you may experience session errors and may need to log-in again for each page you visit on the Sites.</p>
